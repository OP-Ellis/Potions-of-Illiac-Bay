# Potions-of-Illiac-Bay
Adds new potions into world of Daggerfall Unity. 

This is rather small mod (currently) bringing both 12 new recipes and 12 new potions into the game.

All new potions can be crafted with help of usual guild services (mainly Dark Brotherhood, Archaeologists and Temple mixers) or bought as any other potion in the game.

Loot tables been updated as well, so game will both spawn new recipes and new potions as part of loot rewards.
So even if you do not plan to create or buy potions from guild services, you still can find new potions in the world of Daggerfall.

**NEW POTIONS:**
[All new potions function in similar way to every other potion, so effects will scale with character level]

1) Potion of Comprehend Languages - > provides with Comperhend Language effect.
2) Potion of Regenerate Health - > provides with healing over time effect.
3) Potion of Jumping - > provides with jump boosting effect.
4) Potion of Banishment - > provides with ability to destroy daedra type of enemies. Chance based.
5) Potion of Climbing - > provides with climbing enhancing effect.
6) Potion of Light - > provides with ability to destroy undead enemies. Chance based.
7) Potion of Spell Resistence - > provides with spell resistance effect.
8) Potion of Weapon Smith - > allow character to temporarily create items.
9) Potion of Shield - > functions in similar way to "shield" spell, but with potion benefits / restrictions.
10) Potion of Spell Absorption - > provides user with effect similar to "spell absorption" effect. 
11) Potion of Magicka - > provides with one-time spell points replenishing effect.
12) Potion of Regenerate - > provides with magicka replenishing over time effect.

**COMPATIBILITY:**
This mod should have no clear issues with compatibility, as mod simply adds new items into the game.

Development notes
Locale_text_error:
Custom names doesn't seem to be supported for potions. Have to use Internal strings for now.
